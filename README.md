## Problem Statement
Given an array representing n positions along a straight line. Find k
(where k <= n) elements from the array such that the minimum
distance between any two (consecutive points among the k points) is
maximized. Solve using divide and conquer algorithm.

### Theory
The Solution to this problem is based on Binary Search which uses the Divide and Conquer algorithm technique. Divide and Conquer algo involves 3 steps- 
Divide: This involves dividing the problem into some sub problem.
Conquer: Sub problem by calling recursively until sub problem solved.
Combine: The Sub problem Solved so that we will get find problem solution. 
Here, We first sort the array. Now we know that the maximum possible value result is arr[n-1] – arr[0] (for k = 2). We then do binary search for maximum result for given k. We start with the middle of maximum possible result. If middle is a feasible solution, we search on right half of mid. Else we search is left half. To check feasibility, we place k elements under given mid-distance.

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

The overall complexity of the question is O(n*logn).
For Sorting the given array time complexity will be O(n*logn).
Our algorithm uses binary search to find the maximum distance possible for given value of k and the complexity of binary search is O(log n).
To check the feasibility for the given value of k and mid value ,we will traverse the array .Time complexity in worst case will be O(n).

Overall time complexity = O(n*logn)    

---

**Space Complexity**

No extra space is used in this algorithm , so auxiliary space is constant.Only the input array is of size n.
Space Complexity = Input Space + Auxiliary Space ,which in turn equal to O(n).
